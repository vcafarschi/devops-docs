# How to prioritize tasks

## Eisenhower Decision Matrix

- All tasks at work are Important.
  - Some of them can be 'Urgent' and some 'not Urgent'.

- If an task comes that something is not working, like prod then this is the Most Urgent and Important
- Assess the value of your tasks.
  - Take a look at your important work and identify what carries the highest value to your business and organization
- Order tasks by estimated effort.
  - If a task can take less them 5 minutes, do it first
  - If the task takes
  - Eat the frog

- The more important something is, the more urgent.
- What are important tasks ?
  - “Who does this impact?” For example, is a task only going to impact you? Your clients? Your department or company?
  - “What is the reward or outcome of completing this task?” A new client contract? More revenue? A project getting done ahead of schedule?
  - “What is the risk of not completing the task?” Lost clients or revenue? Lost progress on a project?
- What are urgent tasks?


Focus on one task at a time (hint: try not to multitask)

ABCD prioritization

2. Identify urgent vs. important.
   1. The next step is to see if you have any tasks that need immediate attention. We’re talking about work that, if not completed by the end of the day or in the next several hours, will have serious negative consequences (missed client deadline; missed publication or release deadlines, etc.).
    Allocate time to prioritizing your most urgent tasks earlier in the day. If you push these to a later period, you’re at risk of being too busy as the day runs on. Prioritizing based on urgency also alleviates some of the stress when approaching a tight deadline or high pressure workload demands. 

    Check to see if there are any high-priority dependencies that rely on you finishing up a piece of work now. Be sure to contact any member of your team that can help finish any dependencies earlier in the day.
  
3. Assess the value of your tasks.
Take a look at your important work and identify what carries the highest value to your business and organization. As a general practice, you want to recognize exactly which types of tasks are critical and have top priority over the others.

For example, focus on client projects before internal work; setting up the new CEO’s computer before re-configuring the database; answering support tickets before writing training materials, and so on. Another way to assess value is to look at how many people are impacted by your work. In general, the more people involved or impacted, the higher the stakes.

Below are some helpful references to assess the value and importance of your tasks. 

Critical priorities are time sensitive and high value. These include tasks dealing with crises or strict client deadlines.  
High value tasks that are not time sensitive should be considered high priorities. These are tasks that involve thinking, planning and collaboration.  
Medium priorities can be time sensitive but not high in value. Meetings, email communications, and project organizing can fall into this category. 
Low priority projects and tasks are ones that are not time sensitive and do not have high value. You can push these priorities later in the week or drop them entirely.

Order tasks by estimated effort.
If you have tasks that seem to tie for priority standing, check their estimates, and start on whichever one you think will take the most effort to complete. Productivity experts suggest the tactic of starting the lengthier task first. But, if you feel like you can’t focus on your meatier projects before you finish up the shorter task, then go with your gut and do that. It can be motivating to check a small task off the list before diving into deeper waters.
